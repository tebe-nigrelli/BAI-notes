# Bocconi Bachelor in Artificial Intelligence

> 2025-06-20
> After finishing my Bachelor in applied mathematics at Bocconi University, I decided to organise, group and upload my notes, so that they could be useful to someone else for studying or revision.

The [BAI](https://www.unibocconi.it/en/programs/bachelor-science/mathematical-and-computing-sciences-artificial-intelligence) course offers a mixture of theoretical and practical courses, building confidence in different areas of interest:
- **Analysis** : Linear Algebra, single-variable and multivariate Calculus, Linear Programming, Convex Optimisation and Differential Geometry
- **Statistics** : Probability, Statistics, Machine Learning (I, II), Stochastic Processes, 
- **Physics** : Kinematics, Electromagnetism, Statistical and Quantum
- **Computer Science** : C and Python, Algorithms, Modelling
- **Economics** : Decision Theory, Game Theory, Finance
- **Computational Biology** : Neuroscience, (Transcriptomics)

# Subjects
## First Year

All of first year involved learning how to study and adapting to the heavier workload of university. Although I found the subjects fascinating, the content was sometimes overwhelming. In other cases, such as Physics, I thought I understood the content, which led me to overestimate preparation for the exams.

**First Semester**
- Y11 AN1: Mathematical Analysis Mod. 1
- Y11 ALG: Algebra And Geometry
- Y11 CS1: Computer Science Mod. 2
- Y11 ECO: Foundations of Economic Sciences

**Second Semester**
- Y12 AN2: Mathematical Analysis Mod. 2
- Y12 PH1: Foundations Of Physics I
- Y12 CS2: Computer Science Mod. 2
- Y12 PRO: Probability

## Second Year

Once I understood the study methodology better, I experimented with different levels of following classes: since Bocconi does not have mandatory attendence, I decided not to follow Statistics, which turned out to be an oversight. 

**First Semester**
- [Y21 PH2](Y21_PH2): Foundations Of Physics II
- [Y21 DTH](Y21_DTH): Decision Theory And Human Behavior
- [Y21 AN3](Y21_AN3): Advanced Analysis and Optimization Mod. 1
- [Y21 STA](Y21_STA): Mathematical Statistics
- [Y21 GER](Y21_GER): German Language (preparatory)

The whole first semester was a rollercoaster, and I only got things back under control at the end. I benefitted massively from the experience, at the cost of taking Statistics and Analysis 4 in July and September.

**Second Semester**
- [Y22 MMM](Y22_MMM): Machine Learning And Artificial Intelligence
- [Y22 APO](Y22_APO): Advanced Programming And Optimization Algorithms
- [Y22 AN4](Y22_AN4): Advanced Analysis and Optimization Mod. 2
- Y22 Seminars (AIL, DES, BSS): AI Lab, Digital Ethics, Behaviours Skills
- [Y22 FRC](Y22_FRC): French Language and Culture
- [Y22 ARB](Y22_ARB): Arabic Language and Culture (not curricular)

I had a whole linguistic journey in second year: I briefly considered learning German, taking up the preparatory course, but I realised I did not have the drive nor time, so I switched to the easier French, which I already knew, and followed Arabic throughout the semester.

## Third Year

The last subjects of the bachelor involved more mathematics and greater overlap between fields. I found Statistical and Quantum Physics of particular brilliance, since it touched Algorithms, Simulations, Approximations and Statistics. At the same time, I decided to lighten my load by taking a Management elective.

**First Semester**
- [Y31 QPH](Y31_QPH): Statistical And Quantum Physics
- [Y31 GMD](Y31_GMD): Game Theory And Mechanism Design
- [Y31 MFN](Y31_MFN): Mathematical Modelling For Finance
- [Y31 PDI](Y31_PDI): New Product Development and Open Innovation course (Additional Course)

Most of last semester was occupied by the search for summer internships, so I had to make excellent use of my limited time. I also followed a Topology Course as a university internship, in addition to lessons.

**Second Semester**
- [Y32 MMN](Y32_MMN): Mathematical Modelling For Neuroscience
- [Y32 CAN](Y32_CAN): Elements of Real and Fourier Analysis
- [Y32 MLI](Y32_MLI): Mathematical Modelling In Machine Learning
- [Y32 SPS](Y32_SPS): Stochastic Processes And Simulation In Natural Sciences, see also the [pursuit-curves project](https://github.com/quercia-dev/pursuit-curves).
- [Y32 TPA](Y32_TPA): Internship Course in Topology 

Finally, I left my thesis on the Hopfield Network to do in the summer.
